      <p> 
       My name is Geeta Ashok Pogul.  I am 16 years old. I am from Solapur, Maharashtra. There are 9 members in my family including me. They are me, my mother, father, 3 younger sisters, uncle, aunty, and grandfather. My education from class 1 to 10th was done in Sambhajirao Shinde Prashala. I passed out 10th in March 2020 with 90.40%. Then I got admission for 11th grade in HNCC collage but I left that college due to unfavorable conditions during covid-19 pandemic. Then I got admission for computer skilling in SHITI. This is 1 year and Computer related field. In this program, I learned about computer, MS- Office, networking, e-commerce, cyber security, tally and programming languages like HTML and JAVASCRIPT. Amongst all of this I like programming the best. Then my teacher informed me about NEOG-boot camp. It is a web development boot camp. To get admission into this camp I have completed level zero Mark 15 and hopefully I will be able to get in level one which is high level programming and stuff.

        I struggled a lot for completing my level zero project portfolios. I have a computer but an older version which does not support some softwareâ€™s like Github and Visual Studio Code. I watched solutions online and solve problems and repair it. And I started to do project. In this understanding code or logic is more important. It is important to understand code logic yourself. It is not like copy pasting the code; we have to understand and give output based on user input in web applications. So here, I completed my 14 projects and 15th is writing a blog about myself. This is my first attempt at writing and I hope to get better. Practice makes perfect!
