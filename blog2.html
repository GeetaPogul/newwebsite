     <p> Hi there, </p>

     <p> I am Geeta Pogul. A few years ago I visited Shivneri fort which is full of history and splendor. Let me tell you a little bit about the Shivneri fort. I visited the fort with my family. It was a one day outing with my family was lot of fun and it was very memorable. We reached Shivneri fort by bus at 11 am. We enjoyed good and hot breakfast at a restaurant nearby and then we went to see the fort. We booked a guide to show us around at the fort. The guide explained to us that the Shivneri fort is located in Junnar town in Pune. This is the birthplace of the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Shivneri fort has a unique place in the history of Maharashtra. The fort has a small temple of Shivai and images of Jijabai, who were the most famous occupants of the fort. Shivaji Maharaj father’s name was Shri Shahaji Bhosale and mother’s name was Shrimati Jijabai Shahaji Bhosale.</p>

     <p> 
        His mother was extremely religious by nature and we can see how it made a great impact on his upbringing. He grew up studying Ramayana and Mahabharata and showed great interest in religious teaching especially those of Hindu and Sufi saints. He grew up to be a very tolerant king. He was bought up by his mother and his administrator Dadoji Kondadeo, who taught him horse riding, archery marksmanship, patta and other fighting techniques after his father left for Karnataka. He also guided him in the aspects of administration and trained him to become a great leader.

     <p>Shivaji got his first military win at the age of in 1645 by attacking and capturing Torna Fort which was under the Bijapur Sultanate, followed by conquest of other forts Like Rajgad, Kondana Chakan.</p>


     <p> 
        I felt proud of being able to walk the same hallways and the fort as the great leader. The guide showed us around the fort and we were able to understand its qualities and features. I felt really connected to our great history felt really proud to be an Indian. As I saw the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji, I bowed and saluted the great child of Maharashtra and felt very inspired by such a revolutionary hero who defined the history of the Marathas. I gathered a lot of information and took in wonderful sights. We all came back to home in the later that evening after a sumptuous lunch. It was a very memorable and enjoyable day in my life.
